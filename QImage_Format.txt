QImage.Format_Invalid	The image is invalid.
QImage.Format_Mono	The image is stored using 1-bit per pixel. Bytes are packed with the most significant bit (MSB) first.
QImage.Format_MonoLSB	The image is stored using 1-bit per pixel. Bytes are packed with the less significant bit (LSB) first.
QImage.Format_Indexed8	The image is stored using 8-bit indexes into a colormap.
QImage.Format_RGB32	The image is stored using a 32-bit RGB format (0xffRRGGBB).
QImage.Format_ARGB32	The image is stored using a 32-bit ARGB format (0xAARRGGBB).
QImage.Format_ARGB32_Premultiplied	The image is stored using a premultiplied 32-bit ARGB format (0xAARRGGBB), i.e. the red, green, and blue channels are multiplied by the alpha component divided by 255. (If RR, GG, or BB has a higher value than the alpha channel, the results are undefined.) Certain operations (such as image composition using alpha blending) are faster using premultiplied ARGB32 than with plain ARGB32.
QImage.Format_RGB16	The image is stored using a 16-bit RGB format (5-6-5).
QImage.Format_ARGB8565_Premultiplied	The image is stored using a premultiplied 24-bit ARGB format (8-5-6-5).
QImage.Format_RGB666	The image is stored using a 24-bit RGB format (6-6-6). The unused most significant bits is always zero.
QImage.Format_ARGB6666_Premultiplied	The image is stored using a premultiplied 24-bit ARGB format (6-6-6-6).
QImage.Format_RGB555	The image is stored using a 16-bit RGB format (5-5-5). The unused most significant bit is always zero.
QImage.Format_ARGB8555_Premultiplied	The image is stored using a premultiplied 24-bit ARGB format (8-5-5-5).
QImage.Format_RGB888	The image is stored using a 24-bit RGB format (8-8-8).
QImage.Format_RGB444	The image is stored using a 16-bit RGB format (4-4-4). The unused bits are always zero.
QImage.Format_ARGB4444_Premultiplied	The image is stored using a premultiplied 16-bit ARGB format (4-4-4-4).
